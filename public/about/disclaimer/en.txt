Additionally, due to the generally small market capitalization of digital currencies, prices are susceptible to substantial fluctuations influenced by market manipulation and government policies worldwide. Due to price volatility, you may experience significant gains or losses. Any digital asset can experience substantial fluctuations and may even become worthless.
